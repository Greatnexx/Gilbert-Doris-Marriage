                I had been planning this moment for months, but nothing could
                have prepared me for the butterflies in my stomach that evening.
                I knew Doris was the one I wanted to spend forever with, but
                finding the perfect moment felt like the most important mission
                of my life.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-4 text-base leading-relaxed">
                We were at our favorite spotâ€”the little garden where we had our
                first real conversation about our dreams and fears. As the sun
                began to set, painting the sky in shades of pink and gold, I
                realized there would never be a more perfect moment than this
                one, with the woman who had become my whole world.
              </p>
              <p className="text-base leading-relaxed">
                My hands were shaking as I got down on one knee, but the moment
                I saw her faceâ€”the surprise, the tears of joy, the radiant
                smileâ€”I knew everything was exactly as it should be. This was
                our moment, the beginning of our forever.

              <p className="mb-4 text-base leading-relaxed">
                When I finally found the courage to speak, the words came
                straight from my heart: "Doris, you've made me believe in magic
                again. You've shown me what it means to love and be loved
                unconditionally. I can't imagine a single day without your
                laughter, your wisdom, and your beautiful soul by my side."
              </p>
              <p className="mb-4 text-base leading-relaxed">
                "You've turned my dreams into plans, my hopes into certainty,
                and my life into the most beautiful adventure I could have ever
                imagined. I want to wake up next to you every morning, face
                every challenge together, and celebrate every victory as one."
              </p>
              <p className="text-base leading-relaxed">
                "Will you marry me, Doris? Will you be my wife, my partner, and
                my best friend for all the days of our lives?" The rest, as they
                say, is historyâ€”and the beginning of our greatest chapter yet.

              In that perfect moment, surrounded by the golden hour light and
              the scent of blooming flowers, time stood still. Her tears of joy,
              her whispered "yes," and the way she threw her arms around meâ€” it
              was everything I had dreamed of and more. That evening, we didn't
              just get engaged; we promised each other a lifetime of love,
              laughter, and endless adventures together.

                    The moment I finished asking the question, time seemed to freeze. Doris's eyes filled with tearsâ€”the good kind that sparkle like diamonds in the fading sunlight. For what felt like an eternity, she just stared at me, and I could see her processing the magnitude of what I had just asked.
                </p>
                <p className="text-base leading-relaxed">
                    Then, without saying a word, she threw her arms around me with such force that we nearly tumbled over together. Her embrace was everythingâ€”relief, joy, love, and promise all wrapped into one perfect moment. I could feel her heart racing against mine, and I knew that whatever her answer would be, this hug said everything.
                </p>

            <div className="md:w-1/2">
                <p className="text-base leading-relaxed mb-4">
                    We stayed like that for what felt like hours but was probably only minutes, holding each other as the reality of the moment washed over us. She was laughing and crying at the same time, and honestly, so was I. It was messy and beautiful and absolutely perfectâ€”just like our love story.
                </p>
                <p className="text-base leading-relaxed">
                    When she finally pulled back to look at me, her face was glowing with pure happiness. Her smile was brighter than any sunset, more beautiful than any ring I could have chosen. In that embrace, I felt our future beginningâ€”two hearts deciding to beat as one for the rest of our lives.
