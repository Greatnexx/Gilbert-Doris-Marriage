                  <strong>I'm Doris Idoko.</strong> A dreamer, a believer, and
                  a woman who thought she understood loveâ€”until Gilbert walked into
                  my life and redefined everything. He didn't just capture my
                  heart; he awakened parts of my soul I never knew existed.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-4">
                  Before Gilbert, I was complete in my own way. But with him, I
                  discovered what it truly means to be whole. He challenges me
                  to be better, celebrates my victories as if they were his own,
                  and stands by me through every storm with unwavering grace.
                  His laughter is my favorite symphony, his smile my daily
                  sunrise.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-4">
                  Together, we've created a love story that feels both destined
                  and chosen destined because it feels like the universe
                  conspired to bring us together, and chosen because every day
                  we wake up and decide to love each other deeper than the day
                  before.
                </p>
                <p>
                  As I prepare to call him my husband, I'm filled with excitement
                  for all the adventures, quiet moments, and beautiful chaos
                  that awaits us. Gilbert isn't just my future he's my home, my
                  peace, and my greatest blessing. In him, I've found my
                  greatest adventure, and I can't wait to see where our journey
                  takes us next.
